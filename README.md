# Fifa-21_dataset
I have imported the Fifa 21 dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/code/cameronriley/2021-fifa-dataset)
I used data cleaning and data transformation to analyse the data and find out important insights.
I answered the following questions, arised during the descriptive analysis of the data:
  ~ Do China, Saudi Arabia and Ireland posses more younger talent than countries like Spain, France and Argentina? Do they have better future prospects?
  ~ What do you infer about the players with no hit value?
  ~ Which countries have the highest number of players with overall rating over 79?
  ~ Which club has the most attractive pull towards a player? In terms of finance
